If a website could be a multiplayer dream

# what
hallucinate a website in a way that supports backend magic

# why
Bespoke UI demo from Google in the original Gemini launch had me wondering how it would look scaled up to a site

Sure, it can hallucinate a page, but can it be close enough to functional? Imagine AI Minecraft, but multiplayer. 
Now imagine that concept applied to a website.

## why is this just vanilla html
realistically it doesnt have state & the UI itself is mainly innerHTML'd in
why would it need anything else?

## why is this not just a chatbot
get out
