If a website could be a multiplayer dream

# Try it out
Go to the backend folder and run the dev script after setting env variables
- `export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key`
- `export GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key`
^ For now - this will be simplified in the future with a .env file

- `bun run dev` / `npm run dev`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and enjoy the show

# what
hallucinate a website in a way that supports backend magic

# why
Bespoke UI demo from Google in the original Gemini launch had me wondering how it would look scaled up to a site

Sure, it can hallucinate a page, but can it be close enough to functional? Imagine AI Minecraft, but multiplayer. 
Now imagine that concept applied to a website.

## why is this just vanilla html
realistically it doesnt have state & the UI itself is mainly innerHTML'd in
why would it need anything else?

## why is this not just a chatbot
get out
