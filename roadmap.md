# Interesting problems worth solving

- [ ] Page persistence
    - SEO
    - / should be random at all times though
- [ ] Secure practices in a dreamlike environment
- [ ] Streaming the DOM nodes in as the AI generates it
    - potentially by formatting it as emmet abbreviations?
- [ ] Support all media
    - [ ] Video
    - [ ] Audio
    - [ ] Images
    - Could be done by *every* value being an ID that's sent to the client, and then the client can request the media from the server. So text, images, video, audio, etc, no difference. Can include middleman script to fetch the media properly.
# Problems that are actively being worked on

- [ ] Storing EVERYTHING the user sends to the make-believe API 
    - [ ] Catch-all db - vector DB with embeddings of the JSON stored as YAML
